## 🚀 Overview
CodeFlick is a modern, open-source platform built for developers to share, discover, and collaborate on code snippets with ease. As a streamlined alternative to GitHub Gists, it focuses on speed, simplicity, and fostering social coding.

The platform is powered by a robust tech stack, featuring a Go-based backend with the Echo framework, PostgreSQL for database management, and a fun retry mechanism for enhanced reliability. The frontend leverages Nuxt.js with Vue 3 and Nuxt UI, while MinIO ensures efficient object storage.
